### What exactly do I do here?

My role is that of a steward. I am here to assure
the alliance between individual employees and the business
is honored. I am here to assure that this alliance is a mutually
beneficial and transparent one.

An alliance is not a mercenary contract. I am here to make sure
the relationship between the individual and the business is
far more than just a monetary exchange for services. Career growth, 
team health, quality outcomes for business and individuals are my focus.

My focus is not to personally write code. I will provide input and 
Contribute technically, but only in an effort to add value when needed. 
Value in this case coming in the form of strengthening individuals, 
strengthening business practices and providing a more productive and 
healthy environment to work in. Picking up prioritized stories as 
an individual contributor with focus on moving product deliverables 
forward is not my domain. 
That said, I do still write code and as an engineer am passionate about the topic.

Can you gain quorum and support on the team for your idea? 
Can you deliver on your idea? 
Then thats all the permission you need. Go and do it! 
**My role is not to permit or order you to do things, 
my role is to enable and empower you do do things.**
I will be standing right next to you every step of the way providing air cover 
and making sure you have everything you need to be successful. 



### Values

I value diverse perspectives, they yield better outcomes. I value moving with 
intent, focusing on clearly defined outcomes. Outcomes are not solely reserved 
for a business context, nor do I feel business outcomes should take a higher 
priority than individual, team or any other related to the alliances 
existing on the team.

If we are not growing, learning, changing we are failing. 
Change is the only constant, so we can either change or be changed.

Decisions should be made by those closest to the problem domain. Top down decisions 
typically yield poor and uninformed outcomes.

I hope in a years time to make my current self seem unhireable and uninformed.

### How I engage
One must always know the value or outcome an action is
intended to yield. If one is just doing something out
of habit or b/c they have been given direction, absent of
intent, this is typically bad. In my opinion these are indicators
of poor team or individual health. I will always seek
these out and attempt to improve them when possible.

I often state my opinion as direct assertions. Do not take them as fact, 
lecturous or pompous. It's based in the notion of "a strong argument weakly held".
this means state your position clearly and strongly and let it stand 
on its own merit after that. I'll admit my idea isn't as strong, take
the best one on the table and move on. I find little reason to try 
and speak softly on these matters. The exchange is focused on the 
idea's merit not one's personal worth. Always separate the two and try not
to get offended. If you are, let me know and i'll turn down the volume and
make sure others do as well :)
The point is, I do not believe we are here to be combative, we should feel
safe and comfortable to kick around ideas. However, we are also not 
here to be agreeable simply b/c it's more polite. we are here to 
yield the best possible outcomes. Good ideas know no rank or seniority. 
To quote Linus Torvalds 
"bad ideas should be [taken] down aggressively. Even good ideas need to be vigorously defended"

I feel that is how we get to the best outcome. Thoroughly stress all
perspectives and let the best emerge. Quality outcomes is why we are here.


### Quotes/Thoughts

**Thoughts on testing:**
Software engineering is a science (computer science). In science, until something is proven deterministically to be true, it's just a theory. Therefore, until you have passing tests which can deterministacally prove your code is working all you have is a theory. Don't deliver theories deliver facts :) In short, if you don't have passing tests, you don't have working code.  

**Thoughts on ideas, opinions & beliefs (using a quote):**
We must also embrace debate and disagreement in our midst, since that is how we learn and strengthen our own arguments. It’s great to have our “safe spaces” to regenerate in. But spending too much time there only makes us weaker and less able to see what’s actually going on. What we ultimately want to see are individuals unafraid of standing up for what they believe in, even if they’re the only ones in a crowd, and even if that crowd is composed of their own friends. We want to see these individuals supported, even celebrated, because of the strength they’re showing. It’s easy to fit into a crowd. But encouraging individual thought above all else is what this community should always be about.
